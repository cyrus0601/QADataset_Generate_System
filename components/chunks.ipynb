      "transformational shift to redu ction and reuse. Legislative pathways, which could include\n",
      "setting targets, repurposing existing or new infrastructure for reuse, and allocating additional\n",
      "funding, can incentivize this broader shift. Timebound and science-informed targets are likely\n",
      "the most effective, but these should be designed and implemented in such a way as to avoid\n",
      "potential negative unintended consequences.\n",
      "2. Reduction and reuse goals should be incorporated into existing legislative pathways\n",
      "when practical. Policies such as extended producer responsibility (EPR) and deposit return\n",
      "systems (DRS) can provide funding and infrastructure for reduction and reuse and may\n",
      "provide a more manageable approach to mobilizing resources than entirely new legislation.\n",

      "product for recycling or design it to be reusable. However, including reduction and reuse in\n",

      "possibilities or lack of data paralyze potential action. Without well-designed policy and\n",
      "systems change, reduction and reuse targets could create unintended consequences,\n",

      "ensure reduction and reuse work hand in hand. However, the biggest risk is that waiting for\n",
      "too much data will maintain the status quo and prevent much-needed action.\n",
      "4. Some products and systems are better suited for immediate reduction and reuse, while\n",
      "others will require greater investment and consideration. Closed-loop systems (e.g.,\n",
      "closed environments like in-house dining or movie theaters) may be a great fit for reuse, while\n",

      "involvement in decision-making is critical for effective solutions.\n",
      "2. The burden of proof for hazardous chemicals should be shifted from communities to\n",
      "producers. There is growing evidence that plastic and associated chemicals and additives\n",
      "harm health at all stages of the life cycle. However, legal standards for the hazardous\n",
